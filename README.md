# CowinVaccineNotifier
Script checks the available vaccines at cowin.gov.in every minute and send an email, when vaccine is available at decided pincode for 18+ citizens, to the email address.

If you want to run the script using gmail you will need to enable the "allow less secure apps" in google account settings. It is recommended to disable it again once you are done with the script.
